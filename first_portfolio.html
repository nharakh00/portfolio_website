            <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
            <p>
                I am skilled with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python and have my own dedicataed data analytics portfolio.
                The projects on this portfolio are focused on solving real-world business problems using publicly available 
                data. In addition to all this, I have greatly emphasized effectively communicating insights and 
                telling a story with data. Here is a link to my portfolio: https://www.datascienceportfol.io/nharakh00

            <h1>Math Tutoring</h1>
            <p>
                I am a mathematics graduate of SFU and I can tutor grades k-12 and certain post-secondary level mathematics
                courses such as calculus and linear algebra. As a student my studies were focused on pure mathematics and my
                favorite course was topology, though I really enjoyed abstract algebra and real analysis.

            <p>
                I am also in the process of learning web developement and a little bit of web design. With my skills and
                previous experience I know I will be able to pick this up quickly.
